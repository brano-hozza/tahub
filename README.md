# TAHub
Learning of Vue.js and Laravel with my friend Peter :)
## What is TAHub about?
It's cloud/messeging web application.  
Backend is written in **Laravel** where I made REST API.   
Frontend is written in **Vue.js** where I used vue router to navigate through screens.  
## How does authorization works?
For registration you need to gain registration token using command  
`php artisan command:token`  
For every API call u need to pass token which you can get after login.
## Is there some documentation?
Yes! In the public directory there is docs page where is whole documentation :)
